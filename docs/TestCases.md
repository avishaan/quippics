Test Cases
----------------------------------------
The following will outline the test plan at a high level. Since this test plan
is being written well into development, only test plans added at this point forward
will be included in this document under the appropriate header. The point of this
document is to come up with highlevel test plans that cover any logic that the app
will be responsible for. Any trivial test cases should be avoided, focus on business
logic that is specific to the requirements documents.
